# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my portfolio site, my name is Marnix Bloeiman, I am a (open-source) (hobby) programmer, writer, blogger and student.

## About me

Well, I am sixteen-year-old, I have the aspergers syndrome but do not let it ruin 

### Some of the projects or creations I made
- [The 0810-SPL software license](https://github.com/Marnix0810/0810-SPL).
- The initial concept and code for [ECD7](https://software0810.wordpress.com/products/encryptcompressmydrive7/).
- [The MAASL scripting language](https://marnix0810.github.io/MAASL-scriptinglanguage/).
- [MuZikDL](https://marnix0810.github.io/muZikDL/) Youtube Downloader.



## Where to find me?

Okay, my social media life has increased a lot and I have been in a sort of search of where to express my life, for me Twitter has become my most active social media, because I didn't feel comfortable with the Facebook and Instagram (I don't post anything on Facebook and the Instagram interface makes me afraid of sharing things accidentally) apps, my blog is also one of these ways of expression.
